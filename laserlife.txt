Laserlife for wild compo at altparty 2013

Platform: Teensy++ 2.0 (AT90USB1286) @ 16 MHz, Philips SAA1099 sound chip,
micro-sized rc servos, laser pointers, some auxiliary electronics, duct tape.

Audio registers and servo positions updated 64 times per second. A few bugs
make the sound go quite wrong in the more complex scenes (one night for coding
and building, no time for debugging!)

Reproduce it yourself, here's the wiring for the avr chip and saa1099:
- Servos: pulses from 16bit timer 1: OCR1A and OCR1B (PB5:6)
- SAA1099: data lines = PORTC, clock = PD0 (8MHz from 8bit timer 0), A0 = PD1,
  CS = PD2, WR = PD3
- party version hex file in http://sooda.dy.fi/bar/laserlife.hex

and the code in http://github.com/sooda

In case you are going to try to replicate this and are having difficulty with
obtaining the SAA1099 sound chip, contact tkln@IRCNet.
