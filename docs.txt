laser life, a wild demo for altparty 2013
by sooda & tkln

- Teensy++ 2.0 (AT90USB1286) @ 16 MHz
- Servos: pulses from 16bit timer 1: OCR1A and OCR1B (PB5:6)
- SAA1099: data lines = PORTC, clock = PD0 (8MHz from 8bit timer 0), A0 = PD1,
  CS = PD2, WR = PD3
- state update @ 64 hz
- servos: any standard ones, those blue cheap towerpro micro servos on the prod
- the makefiles are copypasta'd and incomplete, use teensy_loader_cli for flashing
